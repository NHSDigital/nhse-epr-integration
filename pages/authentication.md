# Authentication

The strategic solution MUST involve the use of an NHS login account for each and every MyChart users who has an active NHS login account with P9 level of identity verification.

Such solution will provide consistent user experience for all patients by providing a seamless transfer of user journey between the NHS App and MyChart (i.e. the NHS App user will not have to reauthenticate using MyChart specific credentials during at the time of jump-off)

This approach will also ensure retention of NHS App users for all centrally-available features.
