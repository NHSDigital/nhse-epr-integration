# Executive Summary

This document outlines the NHS England strategy for the integration of national health care services, such as Wayfinder, with external EPR systems such as Epic.

The document also provides an overview of the logical integration architecture (with some options), a degree of technical detail, as well references to additional technical specifications and guidelines for implementation. 

Together, all of the above is intended to establish a basis for a continued dialogue between NHS England and Epic that will lead to a successful integration of Wayfinder and trusts which use Epic as their EPR.
