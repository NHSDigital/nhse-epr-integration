# Integration Strategy

NHS Englandâ€™s digital strategy is partly guided by the [NHS Architecture Principles](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/architecture/principles), with the following three relevant in the context of integration:
* Use platforms
  * Digital services should build upon existing platforms to deliver their services
* Reuse before buy/build
  * Digital services should demonstrate that they have sought to reuse existing solutions before delivering new ones.
* Interoperability with open data and technology standards
  * Digital services should adopt open data and technology standards.
